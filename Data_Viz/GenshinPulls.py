# The purpose of this is to simulate the true probabilities of the video game "Genshin Impact" gacha system
# The system to gain certain 5-star characters requires you use a "wish" to win a random chance with low chances
# This low chance as you get further into your attempts has a "pity" system which allows
# Complete: Everything works great, it's an exe and has user input. My only regret is not using textual but next time


# TODO plt.show() creates two figures when only one instance is there, the first figure is also blank
# TODO There is a limit on the number of Five Star Characters, implementing that should be useful
# TODO Some variable to allow different batch sizes for simulations instead of the hard coded 100,000
# TODO Have the text of the plot auto scale to not to touch any bars
