For projects using the python library Manim that creates mathmatical animations.
I am an adult in canada who has no computer science degree or the like but loves math, physics, space, elections, maps and urbanism.
I like making animations and graphs about such things.
Files are split up by the libraries and/or languages used.
You are free to use these files forwhatever non-hateful purpose you'd like make sure to credit me/credit the community I credited (i.e for Manim manim.community/)
